# Method Decorators

`@ApiMethod` composes NestJS route decorators, guards, throttling, and Swagger metadata into a single annotation for manual controller methods that fall outside the auto-generated CRUD surface.

## When to use

- Custom controller endpoints that still need consistent authentication, authorization, and documentation.
- Routes that reuse DTOs generated by the automator but implement bespoke business logic.
- Endpoints that require fine-grained throttling or alternate HTTP status codes.
