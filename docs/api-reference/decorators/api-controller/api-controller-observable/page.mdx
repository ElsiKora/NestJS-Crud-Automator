# `@ApiControllerObservable`

Marks a controller as observable so its CRUD lifecycle emits events to route subscribers. Without this decorator the subscriber registry ignores the controller even if subscribers are registered.

## Signature

```typescript
@ApiControllerObservable()
```

## Behavior

- Sets the `CONTROLLER_API_DECORATOR_CONSTANT.OBSERVABLE_METADATA_KEY` metadata flag on the controller class.
- `ApiRouteSubscriber` instances targeting the same entity receive `before`, `after`, and `error` hooks for each generated route once the flag is present.
- Has no runtime cost unless subscribers exist. Unmarked controllers skip the observable pipeline entirely.

## Usage example

```typescript
@Controller("posts")
@ApiController({
	entity: PostEntity,
	routes: {
		/* ... */
	},
})
@ApiControllerObservable()
export class PostController {}
```

## When to use

- You rely on audit logging, derived DTO changes, or dynamic guard behavior implemented inside `ApiRouteSubscriber` classes.
- You need deterministic ordering between multiple subscribers via priorities.
